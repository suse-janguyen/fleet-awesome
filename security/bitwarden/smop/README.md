### Bitwarden Secrets Manager Kubernetes Operator

The sm-operator uses a controller to synchronize Bitwarden secrets into Kubernetes secrets. The operator registers the Custom Resource Definition: BitwardenSecret into the Kubernetes cluster. The cluster will listen for the newly registered BitwardenSecret, and synchronize on a configurable interval.

  * Documentation: https://bitwarden.com/help/secrets-manager-kubernetes-operator/
  * `external-secrets` operator also as a client, requires cert-manager for bitwarden-sdk-server certs
  * `values00.yaml` in the current dir are directly from the documentation example
  * Note: the `BitwardenSecret` CRD syncs ALL of the secrets owned/readable by a particular machine account, see [this github issue](https://github.com/bitwarden/sm-kubernetes/issues/60) ... for free tier (lab), may want to restrict machine account to 1-3 secrets

_TODO_
- [ ] can fleet pass the `--devel` option to the helm-controller?  (Beta version in current dir as a workaround).
- [ ] test the options with the above
- [ ] kustomize for sdk-server bootstrap Issuer/Cert, secondary bundle, dependent on label like `bw-sdk-server-bootstrap: true` or similar
...
