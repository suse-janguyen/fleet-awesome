### KubeVirt Operator

Currently version 1.5.1, for Kubernetes 1.30, 1.31, and 1.32. See the [user guide](https://kubevirt.io/user-guide/) for more information.

_TODO_

User guide requires bootstrap installation, then the operator, and finally CR definitions afterwards.

* Bootstrap Namespace files under `bootstrap`
* adjust to `cmvalues` once a chart is available.

Tracking for upstream helmchart repo:

* https://github.com/kubevirt/community/pull/224
* https://github.com/kubevirt/project-infra/pull/4093
