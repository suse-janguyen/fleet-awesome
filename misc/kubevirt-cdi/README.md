### Containerized Data Importer

The Containerized Data Importer (CDI) project provides facilities for enabling Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs) to be used as disks for KubeVirt VMs by way of DataVolumes. The three main CDI use cases are:

 * Import a disk image from a web server or container registry to a DataVolume
 * Clone an existing PVC to a DataVolume
 *  Upload a local disk image to a DataVolume

See [the documentation](https://kubevirt.io/user-guide/storage/containerized_data_importer/) for more information.
