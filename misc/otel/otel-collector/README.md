### OpenTelemetry Collector Chart Bundle

The OpenTelemetry Collector offers a vendor-agnostic implementation on how to receive, process and export telemetry data. In addition, it removes the need to run, operate and maintain multiple agents/collectors in order to support open-source telemetry data formats (e.g. Jaeger, Prometheus, etc.) to multiple open-source or commercial back-ends.

See the [github repo](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector) for more information.
